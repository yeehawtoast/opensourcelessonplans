A Complilation of all of my lesson plans from the past two years. While there are many free resourcess for learners, there are not quite as many for teachers who work educate young and new students in computer science. While each student learns in their own way, lessons for computer science should follow these principles:

-- They should be project based. Evience suggests that at least for computer science, guided projects can help shape a student's understanding far better than classic "quiz and lecture" methodologies. This isn't so say that you should provide quizzes, in fact using a combination of quizzes and projects can help make sure students fully grasp concepts that otherwise they may not have.

-- They should cover one(1) objective per lesson. That means, if my unit is on functions, we should ONLY cover one aspect of functions per lesson. For example: If just taught about the structure of a basic function in JS, then I should NOT also cover the detail of how parameters work. Start from the top down. If we are working on functions, then we should not cover branches and loops. "Stake to one song and one song only" -Will Ferrill.

# Formatting
    All lessons should be formatted in the following way:

## Standards
Standards are the national and/or state-level teaching standards that instructors must meet in order for the class to count for credit. Each lesson should meet either 1 or more standards for your state/nations education agency/department/ministry/etc. Rather than listed each standard word for word, I will list the section and reference so I'm not needing to state each standard word for for word.

## "Today we Will" 
Also known as objectives, TwW's are a 1 sentence introduction to the day's subject. It should be short and simple enough to fit in a 10-20 minute lesson while not overcomplicating the subject for students. Remember: the KISS principle applies to education too!

## Guiding Questions
Guiding questions are the discussion questions we can use to help students grasp the TwW.
## Instruction time (using the I do/We do/You do format)
    I do: This is your time to explain the concept.

    We do: This is where you and the students work on problems together. You transition from demonstrating the idea to having students solving the problem set collectively as a class

    You do: Students either break up into teams, or by themselves to do a guided activity. Depending on time, you can branch a guided activity into a lab day if you do not have enough time in class.


## Guided activity
    A guided activity will come from the activities folder. These will be hands-on small problem sets complete with test cases that students can look at an analyze. The test cases should cover unit testing as well as possible edge cases. Experience has taught me that students are very good at coming up with the wildest solutions that, if your tests have not been properly written, can "pass" while still breaking during edge case usage.

## Wrap-up/Exit Ticket
    Wrap-up should be short, simple summaries of what was taught, what you will cover tomorrow and one questions that students can answer on a sticky note and hand to your. These should guage whether or not a student understood the material taught today.
