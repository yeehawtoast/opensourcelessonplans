# UPDATE 
Rather than focus on one specific school system or educational standard and conforming directly to any specific education, knowledge, and standards, I want to make something similar to the Odin Project, but for Computer Science in general. 


Something I've learning over my (young-ish) career is just how different software development is compared to the study of computer science itself. While you can learn discrete math, study verification and validation, it means very little if you can't put what you learn into practice. 

I didn't get my degree in computer science, I was a communications major emphasising public relations. My cs knowledge was minimal at best and my coding skill were sub-par. So how did I go from not good to decent at my job? The answer was pulling from a lot of resources, writing code and building projects. Therefore, I want to help students in a similar way that I was helped. While I hope to not focus on web dev, I do want to cover every major area that is covered by a CS degree, but at a level non-cs majors can understand and with complete open-source access that hopes to get away from corporate-owned MOOCs. 

I will update what I am working on as I progress: 

# Introduction Classes
Learning to Program (Python)- A class for absolute beginners. Similar to CS50 and other such classes.
